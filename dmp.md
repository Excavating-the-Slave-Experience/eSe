# DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN - Excavating the Slave Experience

The Data Management Plan covers the data which will be collected and generated under the Excavating the Slave Experience project.

## Data Description 
The types of data to be collected includes text and images from fugitive slave advertisements published in North Carolina newspapers before the Civil War, North Carolina census statistics, North Carolina slave codes, and major US slave revolts. From these digitized datasets, the project will generate the following textual and visual data: (1) csv tabular data, (2) code used to collect and clean the datasets, (3) metadata, (4) maps, and (5) timelines.
 
## Data Formats and Dissemination 
Data will exist in TXT, CSV, Python, GIS, JPEG, and PNG formats. Metadata will be encoded using the Dublin Core Schema and stored according to best practices. The collected data sets are not restricted by any privacy or copyright concerns. The data will be made freely available to the public through GitHu, a public open-source software distribution site, and the Excavating the Slave Experience project website.

## Data Retention, Storage, and Preservation
The data will be accessible in GitHUB and on a public website platform for a minimum of one year.
